# Paper React Native Test

- The specifications of the problem are listed below. 
- You are free to use **any packages or libraries**. 
- You can create as many files as you like. 
- All related implementation code should be in the `src` folder

## Dev Environment

At Paper we do not use *Expo*, but for simplicity, it is used in this assessment

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Code readability and organization
2. Problem solving skills
3. How you use React features
4. How well the guidelines provided were followed

# Assessment: Trivia App 

## API Instructions
Your goal is to create a very basic trivia app. We will be using data from [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)

When consulting the API, make sure to follow these guidelines when generating the API endpoint we want to call
- Number of questions : 10
- Any category
- Any difficulty
- Any Type
- Default Encoding

## Client Instructions
- With the response that you receive from the API, you are to create a `scrollable list` of all the questions.
- Th e questions are divided based on their difficulty: `easy, medium & hard`
- When clicking a question, it should `redirect the user to a new screen`
- That new screen will `display the question along with the choices`
- When clicking on a choice, the box should `change color`
